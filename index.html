                <p>Inspired by the epic Spaghetti Western films of his youth, Gabe draws on a diversely cultivated skill set to tell expansive but dangerous stories of the frontier -- of space. An Austin based creative, he graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2013 with a Bachelor's in Geological Sciences. After two years in environmental consulting, Gabe stepped away from the industry to pursue another passion -- video editing.</p>
                <p>Finding the editor diet of corporate explainers, social media curated recipes, and such to be ultimately distasteful, Gabe decided to leverage the technical skills he'd gained as an editor to branch into another medium -- sound.</p>                        
                <p>Combining a lifelong love of fiction writing, a passionate study of music and composition, and an instinctive sense of sound design, Gabe set out to craft an ambitiously produced sci-fi action audio fiction podcast. Featuring a full cast, a cinematic score, and epic, immersive sound effects, producing the podcast presents satisfying challenges both technical and creative, but also fosters ideas for new creative pursuits.</p>
                <p>Now, Gabe seeks a new challenge in full stack web development, with an appetite for expanding his creative opportunities.</p>
